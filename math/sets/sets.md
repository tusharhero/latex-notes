# sets

## meaning

- Z+: Set of all positive integers

## methods of representing a set

- roster method
- set-constructor method

### roster method

In the roaster method, we represent all the elements(atleast the first few) between brackets.

For example,

$A = \{1,2,3\}$

If we have a very large set, we represent them like this.

$A = \{1,2,3 ...\}$

### set-constructor method

In the set-constructor method, we directly write the conditions between the brackets
in the following syntax.

$A = \{x:conditions\ regarding\ x\}$

example,

$A = \{x: 3 \geq x \leq 3\}$
