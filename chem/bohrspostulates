Bohr's postulates:

1)Bohr states that most of the atom's mass is concentrated in a very smalla positively charged area called the nucleus, around this electrons revolve in circular orbits.

2) Out of the infinitely possible orbits for e- only those orbits are possible where the angular momentum of the e- is a intregal multiple of h/2pi thus angular momentum is quantized.

3) e- only rotate in these orbit and hence their energies are also fixed for these orbits. With the energy of e- increasing as they go from inner orbit to outer orbit. Hence the energy of e- in an orbit is also quantised

4) As long as the e- stays in these orbits it doesnt loose energy

5) e- can only move from one orbit to another orbit and not in b/w when there is enough energy received from photons and they can go to lower orbits by releasing photons.
