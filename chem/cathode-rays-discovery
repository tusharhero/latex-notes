|>A Discharge tube is taken with electrodes(Cathodes and anodes) connected with a very high voltage(10,000v). A coating of ZnS(Zinc Sulfide) is applied behind the Anode (+ electrode).A pump is used to reduce the pressure of the discharge tube.

|>When we apply the voltage across the discharge tube, We observe that the ZnS coating behind the Anode starts glowing or illuminating.

|>This implies that some rays are hitting it. These rays are called Cathode rays(Because their direction is from Cathode to Anode)

|>When we apply an external electric voltage the Cathode rays move towards the positive terminal this implies that they are negatively charged

|>When we apply an external magnetic force they behave the way an negative particle would.

E/M ratio:
|> Found by JJ thomson
|> JJ thomson found the e/m ratio of the electron by assuming

Properties:

|> They always travel in straight lines

|> They are material particles because they can move a fan placed in front of them
