## Physics: Definitions and Applications

### What Physics Is

Physics is a branch of science which explains how our universe fundamentally works.

The word 'science' comes from a *latin* which means **'having knowledge'**.  And it refers to the knowledge of how the physical world operates, based on the objective(not subjective) evidence obtained through experimentation and observation. And any scientific explanation must be testable. That is why `"God created the universe."` is not a scientific explanation, because It is not testable. While on the other hand, `"Humans and Monkeys share a common ancestor."` is a testable statement and hence scientific.

So, physics refers to the knowledge of how the fundamental aspects of our universe work. Physics involves the study of Electricity to Acoustics (Study of Science) , from Astronomy to Particle Physics, from Quantum Mechanics to Relativity.

We can see how diverse and broad physics is.

### Physics: Past and Present

The word `'Physics'` is thought to have come from the greek word `'Phusis'` meaning *'nature'*. So, it meant the **study of nature** or *Natural philosophy* .
This actually included almost every science we know, such as, Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Medicine ,etc to name a few. But as time passed by these started to specialize into their own branches of Science.

- Physics is broadly divided into 2 parts:
  - [Classical Physics](#classical-physics)
  - [Modern Physics](#modern-physics)

#### Classical Physics

This refers to all the Physics we figured out between the **Renaissance** and the **end of 19th century**. It is a very good *approximation* of reality for objects which are *slower* than **1% the speed of light(`c`)** , large enough to be seen by our naked eyes and involve very weak gravity.

As these are the properties we observe in everyday items, this is good enough for our day to day life.

+ Classical Physics includes:
  + Newton's law of Gravitation
  + Newton's laws of motion
  + Classical Electricity

If the 3 conditions are mentioned before are not met, Classical Physics breaks and is not able to explain any phenomenon, such is the case with Atoms, Blackholes, etc.

#### Modern Physics

Modern Physics was developed in the 20th century and it completely changed our understanding of the universe.

- Modern Physics includes 2 revolutionary theories namely:
  - [The Theory of Relativity](#theory-of-relativity)
  - [Quantum Mechanics](#quantum-mechanics)

##### Theory of Relativity

Theory of Relativity says that time and speed are not absolute and can be different for different people.

##### Quantum Mechanics

When things get too **small** (a lot small) Classical physics stops being applicable to them, some examples are atoms and sub-atomic particles.

The properties and behaviour of these objects are described by Quantum Mechanics. This is also due to the fact that sub-atomic particles easily cross **1% the speed of light(`c`)** .

## Application of Physics

Physics is not only for scientists, It is also helpful for everyone. It can help people understand why 5G cant cause cancer and solve many confusions.

It is used in almost every engineering discipline. And it is also the foundation of many other sciences, such as Biology and Chemistry.

It is also used extensively in th medical field for diagnosing and treating diseases. For example, the knowledge of X-rays is used in finding broken bones and fractures. Ultrasound technology is used to image babies in their mother's womb.

## The Scientific Methods

### Scientific Methods

Scientist often ask questions about the natural world and try to answer them. These may lead to natural laws which are intrinsic to the universe. Which means we can only understand and discover them. We should find the laws as they are and not what we want or imagined them to be.

We all are very curious, We look around and make inferences about our environment. But when we get serious about science, We try to make precise observations and controlled experiments(If possible). write down our ideas about how they work. We can then form hypothesis and laws around them.

It starts with scientist making an observation. The scientist observes a pattern in the natural world.
Then they come up with a hypothesis which is a testable statement which describes how something in the natural world works. Then the scientist conducts experiments to test the hypothesis. If the hypothesis is true the scientist moves to the next one and if it turns out to be wrong the scientist tries to devise a new hypothesis based on the new data from the experiment. They also share their findings with other scientists.

This is essentially the scientific method.

### Modelling

A model is a representation of something which is too complex to be studied directly. Models can take the form of physical models, equations, computer programs, or simulations—computer graphics/animations.

One such example is the model of atoms, because they are so small and fast-moving, our brains can't comprehend them directly. So we make models of them to study them. Like chemical stuctures being represented with models of the molecules.

### Scientific Laws and Theories

A scientific law is a description of a pattern in nature that is true in all circumstances that have been studied. That is, physical laws are meant to be universal, meaning that they apply throughout the known universe.

For example, newton's third law,

> $F = ma$

They can often be expressed as equations or a concise statement.

Scientific ideas and explanations that are true in many, but not all situations in the universe are usually called principles. An example is Pascal’s principle, which explains properties of liquids, but not solids or gases.

Theories are explanations about the world which are supported by scientific evidence and are verified by many scientists. Sometimes people confuse them with [hypothesis](#scientific-methods)
