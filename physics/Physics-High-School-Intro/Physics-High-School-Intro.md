## Physics: Definitions and Applications

### What Physics Is

Physics is a branch of science which explains how our universe fundamentally works.

The word 'science' comes from a *latin* which means **'having knowledge'**.  And it refers to the knowledge of how the physical world operates, based on the objective(not subjective) evidence obtained through experimentation and observation. And any scientific explanation must be testable. That is why `"God created the universe."` is not a scientific explanation, because It is not testable. While on the other hand, `"Humans and Monkeys share a common ancestor."` is a testable statement and hence scientific.

So, physics refers to the knowledge of how the fundamental aspects of our universe work. Physics involves the study of Electricity to Acoustics (Study of Science) , from Astronomy to Particle Physics, from Quantum Mechanics to Relativity.

We can see how diverse and broad physics is.

### Physics: Past and Present

The word `'Physics'` is thought to have come from the greek word `'Phusis'` meaning *'nature'*. So, it meant the **study of nature** or *Natural philosophy* .
This actually included almost every science we know, such as, Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Medicine ,etc to name a few. But as time passed by these started to specialize into their own branches of Science.

- Physics is broadly divided into 2 parts:
  - [Classical Physics](#classical-physics)
  - [Modern Physics](#modern-physics)

#### Classical Physics

This refers to all the Physics we figured out between the **Renaissance** and the **end of 19th century**. It is a very good *approximation* of reality for objects which are *slower* than **1% the speed of light(`c`)** , large enough to be seen by our naked eyes and involve very weak gravity.

As these are the properties we observe in everyday items, this is good enough for our day to day life.

+ Classical Physics includes:
  + Newton's law of Gravitation
  + Newton's laws of motion
  + Classical Electricity

If the 3 conditions are mentioned before are not met, Classical Physics breaks and is not able to explain any phenomenon, such is the case with Atoms, Blackholes, etc.

#### Modern Physics

Modern Physics was developed in the 20th century and it completely changed our understanding of the universe.

- Modern Physics includes 2 revolutionary theories namely:
  - [The Theory of Relativity](#theory-of-relativity)
  - [Quantum Mechanics](#quantum-mechanics)

##### Theory of Relativity

Theory of Relativity says that time and speed are not absolute and can be different for different people.

##### Quantum Mechanics

When things get too **small** (a lot small) Classical physics stops being applicable to them, some examples are atoms and sub-atomic particles.

The properties and behaviour of these objects are described by Quantum Mechanics. This is also due to the fact that sub-atomic particles easily cross **1% the speed of light(`c`)** .

## Application of Physics

Physics is not only for scientists, It is also helpful for everyone. It can help people understand why 5G cant cause cancer and solve many confusions.

It is used in almost every engineering discipline. And it is also the foundation of many other sciences, such as Biology and Chemistry.

It is also used extensively in th medical field for diagnosing and treating diseases. For example, the knowledge of X-rays is used in finding broken bones and fractures. Ultrasound technology is used to image babies in their mother's womb.

## The Scientific Methods

### Scientific Methods

Scientist often ask questions about the natural world and try to answer them. These may lead to natural laws which are intrinsic to the universe. Which means we can only understand and discover them. We should find the laws as they are and not what we want or imagined them to be.

We all are very curious, We look around and make inferences about our environment. But when we get serious about science, We try to make precise observations and controlled experiments(If possible). write down our ideas about how they work. We can then form hypothesis and laws around them.

It starts with scientist making an observation. The scientist observes a pattern in the natural world.
Then they come up with a hypothesis which is a testable statement which describes how something in the natural world works. Then the scientist conducts experiments to test the hypothesis. If the hypothesis is true the scientist moves to the next one and if it turns out to be wrong the scientist tries to devise a new hypothesis based on the new data from the experiment. They also share their findings with other scientists.

This is essentially the scientific method.

### Modelling

A model is a representation of something which is too complex to be studied directly. Models can take the form of physical models, equations, computer programs, or simulations—computer graphics/animations.

One such example is the model of atoms, because they are so small and fast-moving, our brains can't comprehend them directly. So we make models of them to study them. Like chemical stuctures being represented with models of the molecules.

### Scientific Laws and Theories

A scientific law is a description of a pattern in nature that is true in all circumstances that have been studied. That is, physical laws are meant to be universal, meaning that they apply throughout the known universe.

For example, newton's third law,

> $F = ma$

They can often be expressed as equations or a concise statement.

Scientific ideas and explanations that are true in many, but not all situations in the universe are usually called principles. An example is Pascal’s principle, which explains properties of liquids, but not solids or gases.

Theories are explanations about the world which are supported by scientific evidence and are verified by many scientists. Sometimes people confuse them with [hypothesis](#scientific-methods)

## The Language of Physics: Physical Quantities and Units

### The Role of Units

We need to units to know how much there is.

The measurements of physical quantities are expressed in terms of units, which are 
standardized values.

+ How far away is New York from New Delhi? 
  + The answer would be in **km**.
+ How much does the TV weight?
  + The answer would be in **kg**.

Now Imagine if we didn't have standardized units, and everyone used other means to convey the answers.

So, for the first question; If someone answered in **length of my smallest hair**. Imagine how convenient that would be. We would have many confusions.
*How do we know the size on his hair?*

This is the exact reason we have standardized units. They are called ***International System of Units (SI)*** 
### SI Units: Fundamental and Derived Units
In any system of units, the units for some physical quantities must be defined through a measurement process. These are called the base quantities for that system and their units are the system’s base units. All other physical quantities can then be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base quantities. Each of these physical quantities is then known as a derived quantity and each unit is called a derived unit.

The choice of base quantities is somewhat arbitrary, as long as they are independent of each other and all other quantities can be derived from them.

Based on such considerations, the International Standards Organization recommends using seven base quantities, which form the ***International System of Quantities (ISQ)***.


| Quantity            | Name     | Symbol |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Length              | Metre    | m      |
| Mass                | Kilogram | kg     |
| Time                | Second   | s      |
| Electric Current    | Ampere   | a      |
| Temperature         | Kelvin   | k      |
| Amount of substance | Mole     | mol    |
| Luminous intensity  | Candela  | cd     |


#### The Meter
- The SI unit for length is the meter (m).
- In 1983, the meter was given its present definition as the distance light travels in a vacuum in ***1/ 299,792,458*** of a second.
#### The Kilogram
- The SI unit for mass is the kilogram (abbreviated kg).
- it was previously defined to be the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder kept with the old meter standard at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris.
- In May 2019, the scientific community adopted a more stable definition of the kilogram. The kilogram is now defined in terms of the second, the meter, and Planck's constant, h (a quantum mechanical value that relates a photon's energy to its frequency.
#### The Second
- The SI unit for time is the second (s).
- For many years it was defined as ***1/86,400*** of an average solar day. However, the average solar day is actually very gradually getting longer due to gradual slowing of Earth’s rotation.
- Therefore, a new standard was adopted to define the second in terms of a non-varying, or constant, physical phenomenon. One constant phenomenon is the very steady vibration of Cesium atoms, which can be observed and counted. This vibration forms the basis of the cesium atomic clock. In 1967, the second was redefined as the time required for ***9,192,631,770 Cesium atom vibrations***

#### The Ampere
- The SI unit for current is the ampere(A), named after Andre Ampere..
- One ampere is defined as the amount of electric current that will produce an attractive force of ***2.7 × 10–7 newton per meter*** of separation between the two wires (the newton is the derived unit of force).

#### Kelvins
- The SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (or kelvins, but not degrees kelvin). This scale is named after physicist William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, who was the first to call for an absolute temperature scale.
- The Kelvin scale is based on absolute zero. This is the point at which all thermal energy has been removed from all atoms or molecules in a system.
- This temperature, 0 K, is equal to ***−273.15 °C*** and ***−459.67 °F***. 
- Conveniently, the Kelvin scale actually changes in the same way as the Celsius scale. For example, the freezing point (0 °C) and boiling points of water (100 °C) are 100 degrees apart on the Celsius scale. These two temperatures are also 100 kelvins apart (freezing point = ***273.15 K***; boiling point = **373.15** K).

### Using Scientific Notation with Physical Measurements
Scientific notation is a way of writing numbers that are too large or small to be conveniently written as a decimal.

For example, the number $990000$ is too large to write down(tedious to read too).

So, scientists came up with this method to write them.
> $9.9 \times 10^5$

Scientific notation follows this general format,

> $x \times 10^y$

This can be extended to fractions too,

> $= \frac{2}{50}$ 
> $= 0.04$
> $= 4 \times 10^(\neg2)$
