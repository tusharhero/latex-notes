<h3 id="what-physics-is">What Physics Is</h3>
<p>Physics is a branch of science which explains how our universe
fundamentally works.</p>
<p>The word ‘science’ comes from a <em>latin</em> which means
<strong>‘having knowledge’</strong>. And it refers to the knowledge of
how the physical world operates, based on the objective(not subjective)
evidence obtained through experimentation and observation. And any
scientific explanation must be testable. That is why
<code>"God created the universe."</code> is not a scientific
explanation, because It is not testable. While on the other hand,
<code>"Humans and Monkeys share a common ancestor."</code> is a testable
statement and hence scientific.</p>
<p>So, physics refers to the knowledge of how the fundamental aspects of
our universe work. Physics involves the study of Electricity to
Acoustics (Study of Science) , from Astronomy to Particle Physics, from
Quantum Mechanics to Relativity.</p>
<p>We can see how diverse and broad physics is.</p>
<h3 id="physics-past-and-present">Physics: Past and Present</h3>
<p>The word <code>'Physics'</code> is thought to have come from the
greek word <code>'Phusis'</code> meaning <em>‘nature’</em>. So, it meant
the <strong>study of nature</strong> or <em>Natural philosophy</em> .
This actually included almost every science we know, such as,
Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Medicine ,etc to name a few.
But as time passed by these started to specialize into their own
branches of Science.</p>
<ul>
<li>Physics is broadly divided into 2 parts:
<ul>
<li><a href="#classical-physics">Classical Physics</a></li>
<li><a href="#modern-physics">Modern Physics</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>More info,</p>
<h4 id="classical-physics">Classical Physics</h4>
<p>This refers to all the Physics we figured out between the
<strong>Renaissance</strong> and the <strong>end of 19th
century</strong>. It is a very good <em>approximation</em> of reality
for objects which are <em>slower</em> than <strong>1% the speed of
light(<code>c</code>)</strong> , large enough to be seen by our naked
eyes and involve very weak gravity.</p>
<p>As these are the properties we observe in everyday items, this is
good enough for our day to day life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Classical Physics includes:
<ul>
<li>Newton’s law of Gravitation</li>
<li>Newton’s laws of motion</li>
<li>Classical Electricity</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If the 3 conditions are mentioned before are not met, Classical
Physics breaks and is not able to explain any phenomenon, such is the
case with Atoms, Blackholes, etc.</p>
<h4 id="modern-physics">Modern Physics</h4>
<p>Modern Physics was developed in the 20th century and it completely
changed our understanding of the universe.</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern Physics includes 2 revolutionary theories namely:
<ul>
<li><a href="#theory-of-relativity">The Theory of Relativity</a></li>
<li><a href="#quantum-mechanics">Quantum Mechanics</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="theory-of-relativity">Theory of Relativity</h5>
<p>Theory of Relativity says that time and speed are not absolute and
can be different for different people.</p>
<h5 id="quantum-mechanics">Quantum Mechanics</h5>
<p>When things get too <strong>small</strong> (a lot small) Classical
physics stops being applicable to them, some examples are atoms and
sub-atomic particles.</p>
<p>The properties and behaviour of these objects are described by
Quantum Mechanics. This is also due to the fact that sub-atomic
particles easily cross <strong>1% the speed of
light(<code>c</code>)</strong> .</p>
<h2 id="application-of-physics">Application of Physics</h2>
<p>Physics is not only for scientists, It is also helpful for everyone.
It can help people understand why 5G cant cause cancer and solve many
confusions.</p>
<p>It is used in almost every engineering discipline. And it is also the
foundation of many other sciences, such as Biology and Chemistry.</p>
<p>It is also used extensively in th medical field for diagnosing and
treating diseases. For example, the knowledge of X-rays is used in
finding broken bones and fractures. Ultrasound technology is used to
image babies in their mother’s womb.</p>
<h2 id="the-scientific-methods">The Scientific Methods</h2>
<h3 id="scientific-methods">Scientific Methods</h3>
<p>Scientist often ask questions about the natural world and try to
answer them. These may lead to natural laws which are intrinsic to the
universe. Which means we can only understand and discover them. We
should find the laws as they are and not what we want or imagined them
to be.</p>
<p>We all are very curious, We look around and make inferences about our
environment. But when we get serious about science, We try to make
precise observations and controlled experiments(If possible). write down
our ideas about how they work. We can then form hypothesis and laws
around them.</p>
<p>It starts with scientist making an observation. The scientist
observes a pattern in the natural world. Then they come up with a
hypothesis which is a testable statement which describes how something
in the natural world works. Then the scientist conducts experiments to
test the hypothesis. If the hypothesis is true the scientist moves to
the next one and if it turns out to be wrong the scientist tries to
devise a new hypothesis based on the new data from the experiment. They
also share their findings with other scientists.</p>
<p>This is essentially the scientific method.</p>
<h3 id="modelling">Modelling</h3>
<p>A model is a representation of something which is too complex to be
studied directly. Models can take the form of physical models,
equations, computer programs, or simulations—computer
graphics/animations.</p>
<p>One such example is the model of atoms, because they are so small and
fast-moving, our brains can’t comprehend them directly. So we make
models of them to study them. Like chemical stuctures being represented
with models of the molecules.</p>

<h3 id="scientific-laws-and-theories">Scientific Laws and Theories</h3>
<p>A scientific law is a description of a pattern in nature that is true
in all circumstances that have been studied. That is, physical laws are
meant to be universal, meaning that they apply throughout the known
universe.</p>
<p>For example, newton’s third law,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20F%20%3D%20ma"
alt="F = ma" title="F = ma" class="math inline" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They can often be expressed as equations or a concise statement.</p>
<p>Scientific ideas and explanations that are true in many, but not all
situations in the universe are usually called principles. An example is
Pascal’s principle, which explains properties of liquids, but not solids
or gases.</p>
<p>Theories are explanations about the world which are supported by
scientific evidence and are verified by many scientists. Sometimes
people confuse them with <a
href="#scientific-methods">hypothesis</a></p>
<h2 id="the-language-of-physics-physical-quantities-and-units">The
Language of Physics: Physical Quantities and Units</h2>
<h3 id="the-role-of-units">The Role of Units</h3>
<p>We need to units to know how much there is.</p>
<p>The measurements of physical quantities are expressed in terms of
units, which are standardized values.</p>
<ul>
<li>How far away is New York from New Delhi?
<ul>
<li>The answer would be in <strong>km</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How much does the TV weight?
<ul>
<li>The answer would be in <strong>kg</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Now Imagine if we didn’t have standardized units, and everyone used
other means to convey the answers.</p>
<p>So, for the first question; If someone answered in <strong>length of
my smallest hair</strong>. Imagine how convenient that would be. We
would have many confusions. <em>How do we know the size on his
hair?</em></p>
<p>This is the exact reason we have standardized units. They are called
<strong><em>International System of Units (SI)</em></strong> ### SI
Units: Fundamental and Derived Units In any system of units, the units
for some physical quantities must be defined through a measurement
process. These are called the base quantities for that system and their
units are the system’s base units. All other physical quantities can
then be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base quantities. Each
of these physical quantities is then known as a derived quantity and
each unit is called a derived unit.</p>
<p>The choice of base quantities is somewhat arbitrary, as long as they
are independent of each other and all other quantities can be derived
from them.</p>
<p>Based on such considerations, the International Standards
Organization recommends using seven base quantities, which form the
<strong><em>International System of Quantities (ISQ)</em></strong>.</p>

<h4 id="the-meter">The Meter</h4>
<ul>
<li>The SI unit for length is the meter (m).</li>
<li>In 1983, the meter was given its present definition as the distance
light travels in a vacuum in <strong><em>1/ 299,792,458</em></strong> of
a second. #### The Kilogram</li>
<li>The SI unit for mass is the kilogram (abbreviated kg).</li>
<li>it was previously defined to be the mass of a platinum-iridium
cylinder kept with the old meter standard at the International Bureau of
Weights and Measures near Paris.</li>
<li>In May 2019, the scientific community adopted a more stable
definition of the kilogram. The kilogram is now defined in terms of the
second, the meter, and Planck’s constant, h (a quantum mechanical value
that relates a photon’s energy to its frequency. #### The Second</li>
<li>The SI unit for time is the second (s).</li>
<li>For many years it was defined as <strong><em>1/86,400</em></strong>
of an average solar day. However, the average solar day is actually very
gradually getting longer due to gradual slowing of Earth’s
rotation.</li>
<li>Therefore, a new standard was adopted to define the second in terms
of a non-varying, or constant, physical phenomenon. One constant
phenomenon is the very steady vibration of Cesium atoms, which can be
observed and counted. This vibration forms the basis of the cesium
atomic clock. In 1967, the second was redefined as the time required for
<strong><em>9,192,631,770 Cesium atom vibrations</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-ampere">The Ampere</h4>
<ul>
<li>The SI unit for current is the ampere(A), named after Andre
Ampere..</li>
<li>One ampere is defined as the amount of electric current that will
produce an attractive force of <strong><em>2.7 × 10–7 newton per
meter</em></strong> of separation between the two wires (the newton is
the derived unit of force).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="kelvins">Kelvins</h4>
<ul>
<li>The SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (or kelvins, but not
degrees kelvin). This scale is named after physicist William Thomson,
Lord Kelvin, who was the first to call for an absolute temperature
scale.</li>
<li>The Kelvin scale is based on absolute zero. This is the point at
which all thermal energy has been removed from all atoms or molecules in
a system.</li>
<li>This temperature, 0 K, is equal to <strong><em>−273.15
°C</em></strong> and <strong><em>−459.67 °F</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Conveniently, the Kelvin scale actually changes in the same way as
the Celsius scale. For example, the freezing point (0 °C) and boiling
points of water (100 °C) are 100 degrees apart on the Celsius scale.
These two temperatures are also 100 kelvins apart (freezing point =
<strong><em>273.15 K</em></strong>; boiling point =
<strong>373.15</strong> K).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-scientific-notation-with-physical-measurements">Using
Scientific Notation with Physical Measurements</h3>
<p>Scientific notation is a way of writing numbers that are too large or
small to be conveniently written as a decimal.</p>
<p>For example, the number <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20990000"
alt="990000" title="990000" class="math inline" /> is too large to write
down(tedious to read too).</p>
<p>So, scientists came up with this method to write them. &gt; <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%209.9%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E5"
alt="9.9 \times 10^5" title="9.9 \times 10^5" class="math inline" /></p>
<p>Scientific notation follows this general format,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20x%20%5Ctimes%2010%5Ey"
alt="x \times 10^y" title="x \times 10^y" class="math inline" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be extended to fractions too,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B50%7D"
alt="= \frac{2}{50}" title="= \frac{2}{50}" class="math inline" /> <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20%3D%200.04"
alt="= 0.04" title="= 0.04" class="math inline" /> <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20%3D%204%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E%20%7B-2%7D"
alt="= 4 \times 10^ {-2}" title="= 4 \times 10^ {-2}"
class="math inline" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term order of magnitude refers to the power of 10 when numbers
are expressed in scientific notation. Quantities that have the same
power of 10 when expressed in scientific notation, or come close to it,
are said to be of the same order of magnitude. For example, the number
800 can be written as 8 102, and the number 450 can be written as 4.5
102. Both numbers have the same value for y. Therefore, 800 and 450 are
of the same order of magnitude. Similarly, 101 and 99 would be regarded
as the same order of magnitude, 102.</p>
<h4 id="unit-conversion-and-dimensional-analysis">Unit Conversion and
Dimensional Analysis</h4>
<p>To convert one unit to another for example, &gt; <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20v%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1m%7D%7B1s%7D"
alt="v = \frac{1m}{1s}" title="v = \frac{1m}{1s}"
class="math inline" /></p>
<p>We need to convert it to <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20%5Cfrac%7Bkm%7D%7Bh%7D"
alt="\frac{km}{h}" title="\frac{km}{h}" class="math inline" /></p>
<p>We can try converting it by substituion i’e by letting <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%201m%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1km%7D%7B1000%7D"
alt="1m = \frac{1km}{1000}" title="1m = \frac{1km}{1000}"
class="math inline" /> , and <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%201s%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1h%7D%7B3600%7D"
alt="1s = \frac{1h}{3600}" title="1s = \frac{1h}{3600}"
class="math inline" /></p>
<p>But there is a better way,</p>
<p>We know that <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%201000m%20%3D%201km"
alt="1000m = 1km" title="1000m = 1km" class="math inline" /> and <img

<h3 id="accuracy-precision-and-significant-figures">Accuracy, Precision
and Significant Figures</h3>
<p>Science is based on experimentation that requires good measurements.
The validity of a measurement can be described in terms of its accuracy
and its precision.</p>
<h4 id="accuracy">Accuracy</h4>
<p>Accuracy refers to how close the measured values are to the actual
value.</p>
<h4 id="precision">Precision</h4>
<p>Precision refers to how close the measured values are to each other
(regardless of the actual value).</p>

<h4 id="uncertainty">Uncertainty</h4>
<p>The accuracy and precision of a measuring system determine the
uncertainty of its measurements.</p>
<p>Uncertainty is a way to describe how much your measured value
deviates from the actual value that the object has.</p>
<p>In more general terms, uncertainty can be thought ofas a disclaimer
for your measured values. For example, if someone asked you to provide
the mileage on your car, you might say that it is 45,000 miles, plus or
minus 500 miles. The plus or minus amount is the uncertainty in your
value.</p>
<p>The uncertainty in a measurement, A, is often denoted as δA (“delta
A”).</p>
<p>The factors contributing to uncertainty in a measurement include the
following: 1. Limitations of the measuring device 2. The skill of the
person making the measurement 3. Irregularities in the object being
measured 4. Any other factors that affect the outcome (highly dependent
on the situation)</p>
<h4 id="percent-uncertainty">Percent Uncertainty</h4>
<p>One method of expressing uncertainty is as a percent of the measured
value. If a measurement, A, is expressed with uncertainty, δA, the
percent uncertainty is &gt; <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20%5C%25%5Cdelta%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cdelta%7D%7BA%7D%20%5Ctimes%20100%5C%25"
alt="\%\delta = \frac{\delta}{A} \times 100\%"
title="\%\delta = \frac{\delta}{A} \times 100\%"
class="math inline" /></p>
<h4 id="uncertainty-in-calculations">Uncertainty in Calculations</h4>
<p>There is an uncertainty in anything calculated from measured
quantities. If we calculate the area of an Rectangle from measured
values by multiplying, what will be uncertainty in the area? If we are
talking about small uncertainties, We can take the sum of the percent
errors this is called the <strong><em>method of adding
percents</em></strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if a floor has a length of <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%204.00%20m"
alt="4.00 m" title="4.00 m" class="math inline" /> and a width of <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%203.00%20m"
alt="3.00 m" title="3.00 m" class="math inline" />, with uncertainties
of <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%202%5C%25"
alt="2\%" title="2\%" class="math inline" /> and <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%201%5C%25"
alt="1\%" title="1\%" class="math inline" />, respectively, then the
area of the floor is <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%2012.0%20m%5E2"
alt="12.0 m^2" title="12.0 m^2" class="math inline" /> and has an
uncertainty of <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%203%20%5C%25"
alt="3 \%" title="3 \%" class="math inline" /> (expressed as an area
this is <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%200.36%20m%5E2"
alt="0.36 m^2" title="0.36 m^2" class="math inline" />, which we round
to <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%200.4%20m%5E2"
alt="0.4 m^2" title="0.4 m^2" class="math inline" /> since the area of
the floor is given to a tenth of a square meter).</p>
<h4 id="precision-of-measuring-tools-and-significant-figures">Precision
of Measuring Tools and Significant Figures</h4>
<p>An important factor in the accuracy and precision of measurements is
the precision of the measuring tool. The more precise the measuring
tool, the more precise and accurate the measurements can be.</p>
<p>Suppose we measure a pencil to be <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%205cm" alt="5cm"
title="5cm" class="math inline" /> using a ruler which has has 1 cm
increments, we can’t really be sure if it is exactly <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%205cm" alt="5cm"
title="5cm" class="math inline" /> because it can be <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%205.1cm"
alt="5.1cm" title="5.1cm" class="math inline" /> or <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%204.9cm"
alt="4.9cm" title="4.9cm" class="math inline" /> too, if we use a more
precise ruler(With smaller increments). We might find it to be <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%205.1cm"
alt="5.1cm" title="5.1cm" class="math inline" />, we can be sure that it
is <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%205.1cm"
alt="5.1cm" title="5.1cm" class="math inline" /> but still we don’t know
if it is exactly <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%205.1cm"
alt="5.1cm" title="5.1cm" class="math inline" /> it might be <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%205.09cm"
alt="5.09cm" title="5.09cm" class="math inline" /> or <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%205.01cm"
alt="5.01cm" title="5.01cm" class="math inline" />.</p>
<p>In our first measurement, there is only one <em>Significant
Figure</em> and in the second measurement there are two.</p>
<p>The number of significant figures in a measurement indicates the
precision of the measuring tool. The more precise a measuring tool is,
the greater the number of significant figures it can report.</p>
<h4 id="zeros">Zeros</h4>
<p>Zeros are given special consideration when counting <a
href="#precision-of-measuring-tools-and-significant-figures"><code>Sig figs</code></a>.</p>
<p>For example, the zeros in <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%200.009"
alt="0.009" title="0.009" class="math inline" /> are not significant.
But the zeros in <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%2010.69"
alt="10.69" title="10.69" class="math inline" /> are.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, If the zeros are not visible in the <a
href="#using-scientific-notation-with-physical-measurements">Scientific
Notation</a>. Then they are not significant. If we go back to our
example <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%200.009%20%3D%209%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E%7B-3%7D"
alt="0.009 = 9 \times 10^{-3}" title="0.009 = 9 \times 10^{-3}"
class="math inline" /> and we cant see any zeros here. If we do the
other example , i’e <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%2010.69%20%3D%201.069%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E%7B1%7D"
alt="10.69 = 1.069 \times 10^{1}" title="10.69 = 1.069 \times 10^{1}"
class="math inline" />. We can still see the zeros this time.</p>
<p>As a side note, If a measurement specifically has a zero in the
scientific notation, It means that zero is actually significant. And if
we find ourselves a measurement like <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%201.0%20m"
alt="1.0 m" title="1.0 m" class="math inline" /> the zero here is
significant and not just a trivial detail.</p>
<h4 id="significant-figures-in-calculations">Significant Figures in
Calculations</h4>
<p>When combining measurements with different degrees of accuracy and
precision, the number of significant digits in the final answer can be
no greater than the number of significant digits in the least precise
measured value.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For Multiplication and Divison; the same number of significant
significant digits as in the least precise value.</li>
<li>For Addition and Subtraction; the answer should have the same number
places (e.g. tens place, ones place, tenths place, etc.) as the
least-precise starting value.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to note that rules 1 and 2 are not the same, while
the first one is talking about the number of significant figures. The
second one is talking the number of number-places before and after the
decimal point.</p>
<p>Another thing to notice is that we should start thinking about the
Significant Figures at the end of the calculation.</p>
