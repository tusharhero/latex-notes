# Motion

## Defining Motion

Objects are always moving everywhere, We see cars and planes moving very fast. We also see Ants moving.

Whenever objects are moving we say that they are in motion.

We can say that motion is change in position over time. But more precisely, It is the change in position relative to a *reference point* over time.

This reference point is a conveniently choosen point. For example, If a rocket is being fired into space, a good reference point would the entire earth as a whole.
When we are in the classroom, we could say that the best one would be the blackboard.

Now Imagine that you are 3 friends X,Y , and Z. Lets say X is going out of the room while Y is entering into the room at the exact speed while Z is just sitting there. If we take X as the reference point, X will appear to be at rest, and Y and Z moving in opposite directions. If we take X as the reference point, Z will appear to be moving towards to the inside the room and Y will appear to go at double the speed into the room.

We can also imagine the reference point as a point which we assume to be staitionary.
