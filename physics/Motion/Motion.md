## Defining Motion

Objects are always moving everywhere, We see cars and planes moving very fast. We also see Ants moving.

Whenever objects are moving we say that they are in motion.

We can say that motion is change in position over time. But more precisely, It is the change in position **relative** to a *reference point* over time.

This reference point is a conveniently choosen point. For example, If a rocket is being fired into space, a good reference point would the entire earthüåç as a whole.
When we are in the classroom, we could say that the best one would be the blackboardüßë‚Äçüè´.

Now Imagine that you are 3 friends X,Y , and Z. Lets say X is going out of the room while Y is entering into the room at the exact speed while Z is just sitting there. If we take X as the reference point, X will appear to be at rest, and Y and Z moving in opposite directions. If we take X as the reference point, Z will appear to be moving towards to the inside the room and Y will appear to go at double the speed into the room.

We can also imagine the reference point as a point which we assume to be staitionary.

## Distance vs. Displacement

Distance refers to the change in position when we travel from one point to another.

While on the other hand, Distance refers to the length of the path one has to take to travel from one point to another.

In physics, the use $d$ to represent the position of the object, and $d_0$ and $d_f$ respectively for the initial and final position of the object.

It is important to note that these two may not be the same always. For example,

You go to your friend's houseüè†, the road you take may not be shortest one, there maybe some turns here and there. This increases the distance. When you reach your friend's houseüè†. The Displacement will be much lower than the distance you have travelled.

Displacement is a vector and distance travelled is a scalar.

Vector is a quantity which has a magnitude and direction associated with it. While Scalar is a quantity with magintube and no direction associated with it.

if we assume the direction of friend's houseüè† to be East , And assume the length of the shortest line between the points to be $1 km$, then our Displacement would be $1 km\ to\ the\ East$. If we say the path is $2 km$ long then the distance travelled would be $2 km$. Now Imagine if you return back to your houseüè†, this would mean that $d_0 = d_f$, hence the Displacement would be $0$ but the distance travelled would be $4km$.

You can calculate an object's displacement by subtracting its original position, d0, from its final position df. In math terms that means:

$$
\Delta d = d_f - d_0
$$
and if $d_f = d_0 = \sigma$ then,

$$
\Delta d = \sigma - \sigma
$$

$$
\Delta d = 0
$$

Hence the displacement will be 0.

In 1d, we can have a origin and we can assume the left side to be $ve^-$ and the right to be $ve^+$.

**practice question.**

```
A cyclist rides 3 km west and then turns around and rides 2 km east. 

(a) What is her displacement? 

(b) What distance does she ride? 

(c) What is the magnitude of her displacement?
```

## Speed and Velocity

### Speed

The description of how slow or fast an object is moving is called its speed. Speed is the rate at which an object changes it position. It is scalar quantity so it doesn't have any direction associated with it.

Since it is a rate, We can say it depend on the time interval of motion. We can calculate the time interval $\Delta t$ using the following formula.

$$
\Delta t = t_f - t_0
$$
 
Here $t_0$ and $t_f$ are the beginning and ending time respectively.

its S.I unit is $\frac{m}{s}$.

When you describe an object's speed, you often describe the average over a time period. Average speed, $\textit{v}_{avg}$, is the distance traveled divided by the time during which the motion occurs.

$$
\textit{v}_{avg} = \frac{distance}{time}
$$

Speed at a specific instant in time, however, is its instantaneous speed. A car's speedometer describes its instantaneous speed.


**practice question.**

```
A marble rolls 5.2 m in 1.8 s. What was the marble's average speed?
```

### Velocity

Velocity describes the speed and direction of an object. So, it is a Vector.

It is analogous to Displacement, Its magnitude is not equal to the speed.(atleast not always)

Average velocity is displacement divided by the time over which the displacement occurs.

$$
\textbf{v} = \frac{distance}{time} = \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t} = \frac{d_f-d_0}{t_f-t_0}
$$

**practice question.**

```
A student has a displacement of 304 m north in 180 s. What was the student's average velocity?
```
