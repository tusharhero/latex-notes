## Physics: Definitions and Applications

### What Physics Is

Physics is a branch of science which explains how our universe fundamentally works.

The word 'science' comes from a *latin* which means **'having knowledge'**.  And it refers to the knowledge of how the physical world operates, based on the objective(not subjective) evidence obtained through experimentation and observation. And any scientific explanation must be testable. That is why `"God created the universe."` is not a scientific explanation, because It is not testable. While on the other hand, `"Humans and Monkeys share a common ancestor."` is a testable statement and hence scientific.

So, physics refers to the knowledge of how the fundamental aspects of our universe work. Physics involves the study of Electricity to Acoustics (Study of Science) , from Astronomy to Particle Physics, from Quantum Mechanics to Relativity.

We can see how diverse and broad physics is.

### Physics: Past and Present

The word `'Physics'` is thought to have come from the greek word `'Phusis'` meaning *'nature'*. So, it meant the **study of nature** or *Natural philosophy* .
This actually included almost every science we know, such as, Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Medicine ,etc to name a few. But as time passed by these started to specialize into their own branches of Science.

- Physics is broadly divided into 2 parts:
  - [Classical Physics](#classical-physics)
  - [Modern Physics](#modern-physics)

More info,

#### Classical Physics:

This refers to all the Physics we figured out between the **Renaissance** and the **end of 19th century**. It is a very good *approximation* of reality for objects which are *slower* than **1% the speed of light(`c`)** , large enough to be seen by our naked eyes and involve very weak gravity.

As these are the properties we observe in everyday items, this is good enough for our day to day life.

+ Classical Physics includes:
  + Newton's law of Gravitation
  + Newton's laws of motion
  + Classical Electricity

If the 3 conditions are mentioned before are not met, Classical Physics breaks and is not able to explain any phenomenon, such is the case with Atoms, Blackholes, etc.

#### Modern Physics:

Modern Physics was developed in the 20th century and it completely changed our understanding of the universe
